# Multitask Prostate Segmentation and Cancer Classification Model Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a dual-purpose model capable of both segmenting the prostate region from medical images and classifying the presence of prostate cancer. The multitask approach leverages deep learning techniques to streamline the workflow and improve disease detection capabilities.

## Dataset
- **Dataset:** PI-CAI
- **Number of Patients:** 673 anonymized patients
- **Patient Breakdown:** 352 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer
- **Data Modalities:**
  - ADC
  - HBV
  - T2W (middle slice Â±1)

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Main programming language used in the project.
- **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch.
- **UNet Architecture:** Attention-UNet. Core deep learning model for segmentation and classification tasks.
- **Other Libraries and Tools:**
  - NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.
  - OpenCV for image processing.
  - Scikit-learn for additional machine learning utilities and evaluations.

## Classification Results (Overview)
- **Average Accuracy:** 73.8%
- **AUROC:** 83.5%
- **Recall:** 85.0%
- **Specificity:** 62.2%
*Note: These results were obtained without the segmentation feature being active during classification.*

## Segmentation Results (Overview)
- **Segmentation Performance:** 70%
*Note: This segmentation result is reported independently from the classification results.*

## Getting Started
To get started with the project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Have installed Python, CUDA, Pytorch and other libraries.
3. Review the project structure to understand how data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts are organized.
4. Run the experiments using the provided scripts and configurations.

## Note
For proper functionality, a dedicated GPU is required.
